# Name of Project

One Paragraph of project description goes here. Link to the live version of the app if it's hosted on Heroku.

Wishlist! 
Problem: My family members would often ask me about what I desired for holidays/birthdays and oftentimes I would ask them to just send me money or a gift card. I wanted an easy solution to tracking not only gift ideas for myself but could also be flexible enough to be worked around other gift tracking ideas.
Solution: I designed and programmed a wishlist application in order to keep track of individual userâ€™s desires as well as provide a creative solution to letting users define and track those items with simple UI. Each list can be sent to others through email where they can keep track of what items are listed as well as check off items they have bought, the user can be either notified or not as part of a surprise!
